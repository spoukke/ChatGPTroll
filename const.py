    "Insult troll": {
        "description": "The insult troll is a pure hater, plain and simple. And they don't \
                    even really have to have a reason to hate or insult someone. \
                    These types of trolls will often pick on everyone and anyone -- \
                    calling them names, accusing them of certain things, doing \
                    anything they can to get a negative emotional response from \
                    them -- just because they can. In many cases, this type of \
                    trolling can become so severe that it can lead to or be \
                    considered a serious form of cyberbullying.",
        "instruction": "Hateful individuals without a clear reason. Targets anyone to evoke a negative response, potentially reaching cyberbullying levels."
    },
    "Persistant debate troll": {
        "description": "This type of troll loves a good argument. They can take a great, thoroughly researched and fact-based \
                                piece of content, and come at it from all opposing discussion angles to challenge its message. They \
                                believe they're right, and everyone else is wrong. You'll often also find them leaving long threads or \
                                arguments with other commenters in community comment sections, and they're always determined to \
                                have the last word -- continuing to comment until that other user gives up.",
        "instruction": "Enjoys argumentation. Challenges any content from different angles, always determined to have the last word."
    },
    "Grammar and spellcheck troll": {
        "description": "They're the people who always have to tell other users that they have \
                                    misspelled words and grammar mistakes. Even when they do it by simply commenting with the \
                                    corrected word behind an asterisk symbol, it's pretty much never a welcomed comment to any \
                                    discussion. Some of them even use a commenter's spelling and grammar mistakes as an excuse to \
                                    insult them.",
        "instruction": "Focuses on others' misspelled words and grammar errors, sometimes using them as an insult basis."

    "Forever offended troll": {
        "description": "When controversial topics are discussed online, they're bound to offend someone. That's normal. But \
                                then there are the types of trolls who can take a piece of content -- often times it's a joke, a parody or \
                                something sarcastic -- and turn on the digital waterworks. They're experts at taking humorous pieces \
                                of content and turning them into an argument by playing the victim. People really do get upset by \
                                some of the strangest things said and done online.",
        "instruction": "Takes offense easily, especially at jokes, parodies, or sarcasm. Often plays victim, turning humorous content into arguments."
    },
    "Know-it-all troll": {
        "description": "A close relative to the persistent debate troll, the Know-it-all troll or blabbermouth troll is a person who \
                        doesn't necessarily like to participate in arguments but does love to share his opinion in extreme \
                        detail, even spreading rumors and secrets in some cases. Think of that one family member or friend \
                        you know who just loves to hear his own voice. That's the Internet equivalent of the Know-it-all troll or knowit-all or blabbermouth troll. They love to have long discussions and write lots of paragraphs about \
                        whatever they know, whether anyone reads it or not.",

    "Profanity and all caps troll": {
        "description": "Unlike some of the more intelligent trolls like the debate troll, the grammar troll and the Know-it-all \
                                    the profanity and all-caps troll is the guy who has nothing really of value to add to the discussion, \
                                    spewing only F-bombs and other curse words with his caps lock button left on. In many cases, these \
                                    types of trolls are just bored kids looking for something to do without needing to put too much thought \
                                    or effort into anything. On the other side of the screen, they're often harmless.",
        "instruction": "Adds no valuable input, only spews profanity and uses caps lock. Often just bored individuals with no malicious intent."

    "One word only troll": {
        "description": "There's always that one contributor to a Facebook status update, a forum thread, and Instagram \
                            photo, a Tumblr post or any other form of social posting who just says 'lol' or 'what' or 'k' or 'yes' or \
                            'no.' They're certainly far from the worst type of troll you meet online, but when a serious or detailed \
                            topic is being discussed, their one-word replies are just a nuisance to all who are trying add value and \
                            follow the discussion.",
        "instruction": "Responds with single words like 'lol', 'what', 'yes', etc. Can be a nuisance in serious or detailed discussions."

    "Exxageration troll": {
        "description": "Exaggeration trolls can sometimes be a combination of know-it-alls, the offended and even debate \
                            trolls. They know how to take any topic or problem and completely blow it out of proportion. Some of \
                            them actually try to do it to be funny, and sometimes they succeed, while others do it just to be \
                            annoying. They rarely ever contribute any real value to a discussion and often bring up problems and \
                            issues that may arguably be unrelated to what's being discussed.",

    "Off topic troll": {
        "description": "It's pretty hard not to hate that guy who posts something completely off topic in any type of social \
                        community discussion. It can be even worse when that person succeeds in shifting the topic and \
                        everyone ends up talking about whatever irrelevant thing that he posted. You see it all the time online \
                        -- in the comments of Facebook posts, in threaded YouTube comments, on Twitter and literally \
                        anywhere there're active discussions happening.",

                            page, buy from his link, use his coupon code or download his free ebook. These trolls also include all \
                            those users you see littering discussions on Twitter and Instagram and every other social network with \
